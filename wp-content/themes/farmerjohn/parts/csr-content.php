	<p class="text-left">Throughout the year, Farmer John and its employees stay actively involved in giving back to the community. Working with public service organizations like The Midnight Mission, we partake in food drives and clothing donations for those in need. We also run with families in 5K and 10K races to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer, crisis shelters and the homeless. Our pro-active approach to sustainable solutions is also layered in to everything we do, with over 30 percent of Farmer John employees carpooling to work to reduce emissions. Learn about all of the ways Farmer John stays committed to the local community.</p>

		<p>Hunger and malnutrition are realities faced by many people. Farmer John and its employees help reduce the impact of hunger by partnering with organizations like The Midnight Mission to cook and serve meals in the heart of Downtown LA’s Skid Row. We also contribute to causes like St Vincent’s Meals on Wheels. Through year-round donations and volunteer efforts, Farmer John continuously provides relief to those in need with locally made products.</p>

			<p>The Farmer John team is constantly upgrading its systems to reduce water usage and water waste. We recently set out to achieve a reduction in fresh water use of 2 percent compared to use in 2013. Through four different water conservation projects, including high pressure water system automation, condensing tower treatment automation, wash cabinet water and waste water load reduction, we were able to achieve a total savings of 27,861,000 gallons of water, which is equivalent to 222,888,000 16 oz. bottles of water.</p>

			<p>Air pollution is a global issue, and one which demands even greater attention in Los Angeles County. Because of this, we do our best to ensure our carbon footprint is kept in check. We process all food in our Vernon, CA location, which means trucks travel much shorter distances to distribute to retailers. Our employees also do their part, with over 30 percent of the Farmer John workforce commuting via carpools, walks, bike rides and public transportation in order to reduce harmful air pollutants in our region.</p>

			<p>Farmer John has an exceptional track record for its responsible management of waste. Our company values the importance of using all parts of the animal and has developed sophisticated systems for renewable energy. We pride ourselves on our 100 percent Landfill-Free waste processing approach, which was recognized by the City of Vernon in 2012. Through initiatives aimed at converting waste to energy, we generate 0.2 megawatts of electricity annually, or enough to power 343 homes in LA. By mixing ash with cement, our facility produces 498 tons of road base aggregate, which is equivalent to 906 feet of paved road.</p>
