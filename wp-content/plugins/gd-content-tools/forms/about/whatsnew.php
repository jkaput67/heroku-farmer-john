                <h3>WordPress 5.0 Block Editor</h3>
                <p>
                    With WordPress 5.0, a new editor will be included under the name Block Editor. It is a Gutenberg editor merged into the core and renamed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GD Content Tools Pro allows you to configure each type to use either Block or Classic editor, with Classic editor set as a defult at this time. In the future, that might change in favor to Block editor as default.

                <p>
                    Meta fields for Time and DateTime both show the Time portion of the datetime picker, and from now on, you can control some additional settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time settings include two options: change the mode between 12 hours and 24 hours, and hide or show seconds selection (seconds will be saved, this option affects the datetime picker).

                <p>
                    Tagged addon built into the plugin no longer uses Zemanta and Alchemy API's (they no longer work for what is needed here), and other taggers are switched to SSL versions.
