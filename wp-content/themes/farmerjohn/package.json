The purpose of FoundationPress, is to act as a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design. FoundationPress is meant to be a starting point, not the final product. If you're looking for an all-in-one theme with built-in shortcodes, plugins, fancypancy portfolio templates or whatnot, I'm afraid you have to look elsewhere.",
